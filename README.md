# 32--Bit-single--cycle-RISC-V-MicroMIPS-processor-usingVerilog-HDL
The implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V singlecycle MicroMIPS processor is the primary goal of this 
project. The processor is designed in Verilog HDL in the 
Quartus tool (Altera) and simulated using Modelsim. It 
executes each instruction in a single cycle and supports a 
basic instruction set (the basic 22 instructions of 
MiniMIPS). Instructions for R-type, Itype, and Jump are 
used to operate this processor. Using Modelsim, the Verilog 
code designs and generates various processor blocks in a 
top-level module that simulates the Working of a 32-bit 
RISC-V
